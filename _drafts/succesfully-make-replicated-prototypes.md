title: make replicated prototypes for a profit
---

There's a feeling in the startup world these days that if you can't scale to some hundred million users, your idea isn't worth a thing. I want to share my particular experience of building and scaling a company while making nearly individual products.

It's the focus of the whole **DIY / Makers** movement to build on the idea that you can manufacture for your own needs, but they really work and think at a consummer scale. Businesses also feel the need for tailor-made solutions at a mass-market price. However, they have stricter requirements that makes buying a 3D printer and hand-assembling things not an option.

Holusion is a small startup in the holograms business. Not those scientific laser diffraction patterns, but the fancy **ghost images** you've seen [here](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tupac-coachella-hologram-behind-the-technology/) and [there](http://cinimodstudio.com/portfolio/ralph-lauren-holographic-window-display/).

It's mainly a communication device and as such, fall under corporate communication rules :

- Only premium companies will pay a premium price
- Every company want a premium feeling to its communication
