  <p>
    My entrepreneur adventure is mainly about doing what I love :
    Solving real world problems, designing from the ground up a product, an infrastructure, a service, etc...
  </p>
  <p>
    It gave me an opportunity to find my limits and know what I can do on my own, or when I need assistance.
    Learning to make highly complex decisions, hire the good people, communicate about what makes a project great. That's what I love about my job.
