This is an exploration of the newest (as of Jan. 2016) web technologies. It provides the polyfills to run on chrome/firefox stable but is by no mean designed for a wide browser compatibility.

Think of it as a "what would vanilla web development look like in 2 years" experiment.

Currently used bleeding edge features :
- JS
  - classes (chrome 42, gg 45, MS Edge 13, Safari 9.0)
  - imports (Not Supported)
- HTML
  - imports (easily polyfilled. Not important.)


## TODO

rebuild webcomponents to only have the html import polyfill
